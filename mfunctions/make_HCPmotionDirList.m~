function pathsList = make_HCPmotionList(HCP_path,paradigm_phaseencoding,nSubject)
%This function creates a list of the directories and file names containing the values of
%the 6 parameters from the affine registration to be used as movement
%regressors. The subjects are chosen in the order in which they appear when using the
%<ls> unix command.
%   This function aids in the creation of lists that can then be input into
%   functions that build matrices of motion parameters for the special case of
%   the HCP data.
% INPUT:
%   HCP_path:  string containing the path to the HCP sampler data
%
%   paradigm_phaseencoding:  string containing the name of the folder
%   containing the results of the desired paradigm along with 
%   the phase-encoding direction (either RL or LR), e.g., "tfMRI_MOTOR_RL"
%
%   nSubject: the desired number of subjects for use in the analysis.
%
% OUTPUT:
%   pathsList: a list of length nsubjects of the directories containing the
%   HCP motion data for each subject. (The subjects chosen are the first nsubjects
%   when listed using ls, which can be viewed by printing pathsList.)
%

subjects = regexp(ls(HCP_path),'\s+','split');
subjects = subjects(1:nSubject); %because sometimes a trailing "" appears in the list
pathsList = cell(1,nSubject);

    subject = char(subjects(n));
    pathsList(n) = {[HCP_path,'/',subject,'/MNINonLinear/Results/',paradigm_phaseencoding,...
